Sencha demo to show how to create a REST JSON connection:

  * a User model with typical fields: id, name, and email.
  * a User Proxy data Store set up to use REST and JSON.
  * a REST JSON request that can create and access users.

This demo is a simulation:

  * The request is simulated by reading/writing a local file.
  * The file includes a simulated JSON response.

This demo is based on the Sencha tutorials and documentation.
